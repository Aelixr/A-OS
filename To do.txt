<| Organized |>


[K]	Absolute coding style:
	-	Prefix ALL methods with their appropriate exposure literal
	-	public/private/protected method_name(arguments:types):return_type {}
	
	
[A]	Input receiving / controlling in a modular multi instance way:
	-	Super class InputReceiver has two subclasses, MouseReceiver and KeyboardReceiver.
	-	Class InputController is an abstract class by its abstract update():void method.
	-	Any entity that requires input, from the UI (User Interface) to the player's character in-game
		will take an InputController component and override its update method (and maybe several fields? =>
		potentially have entities simply use a subclass of inputController, made for them. This is less modular,
		however, but will be the most consistent... hmmm
	-	Ship.inputController.keyDown(InputController.KEYCODES.W, function() { ship.moveForward()}

		

[A]	Upgrade project to Natty's new JSPM/SystemJS boilerplate


[A]	Use absolute paths somehow in place of import "../../../../../../module";


[K]	Clean up every file to maintain consistent style


[K]	In [Framework/utility.ts] create a Util folder with helper modules inside, such as Vector2d


[*]	Create semi-large update iteration backups stored on dropbox (zipped)
	-	Copy and revert main project folder to V0.1.0
	
	
[A]	MUST find and use any license files from any external modules!
	-	JQuery		|	Plan to use
	-	Socket.io	|	Using client and server socket.io TODO:INCLUDE
	-	Node.js		|	Using TODO:INCLUDE
	-	Typescript	|	Using but doubt this needs a license TODO:INCLUDE/FINDOUT
	

[K] Organize the unorganized below


[A] Text document with strict coding style rules 



<| unorganized / ideas |>

make some kind of logging module with global enable/disable whether debug mode is on or not

Program the camera entity/viewport
include a target entity or focus point

make ship entity

have the entity handler give entities with transform, and renderer components to the renderHandler:
thus removing the coupling where components must know their parent entities.

familiarize yourself with the project (and formatting) i have somme bad news for thursday - saturday.
